## Hi there! üëã

I'm Samuel Akujor, a Mobile Engineer specializing in Flutter and cross-platform development.

### üå± What I'm currently learning

I'm always pushing boundaries!

Right now, I'm diving deeper into advanced Flutter optimizations, AI integrations like OpenAI APIs, Native Development and full-stack synergies with Node.js.

I'm also exploring emerging tools in fintech security and real-time systems‚Äîas long as they align with scalable, user-centric design! üòä

### üë®‚Äçüíª My technical expertise

As a Mobile Engineer with 4+ years of experience architecting apps from scratch for 50k+ users, I bring deep expertise in:

- Flutter and Dart for building high-performance, cross-platform applications.
- Architectures like MVC, MVVM and Feature-First with Repository Patterns.
- State management preferably with Riverpod but fluid with GetX, Providers; amongst others.
- Performance optimizations including lazy loading, memory pooling, isolates, latency reductions ...
- Security implementations such as AES encryption, biometric auth, API obfuscation; secure storage.
- API integrations, including WebSockets, cloud services like Firebase and Google Cloud
- Testing frameworks: Unit, widget, and integration testing (e.g., Patrol)
- DevOps tools: CI/CD pipelines with Codemagic, Fastlane, and GitHub Actions.
- Additional tools: Git, Figma, Agora SDK, Jira, Discord, Chucker ...

I've led teams of 2-4 engineers, transformed legacy codebases, and delivered User Experience focused mobile apps in Fintech, Ride Hailing Services and social platforms.

### üìö Articles and Talks

I love sharing knowledge on mobile engineering, architecture migrations, and performance tuning.

I'll be doing a couple of technical write ups and keepig this updated as i publish them.

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Fan of Open Source

I'm passionate about contributing to collaborative projects.

While I've focused on proprietary fintech and social apps, my personal projects showcase my commitment:

- Reply Genie: An AI-powered Flutter app with OpenAI integration for context-aware responses, OCR/ASR processing, and Riverpod state management
- Comiles: A ride-hailing platform built with Feature-First Architecture, real-time maps, Agora SDK for VoIP/messaging, and WebSockets for <3s latency
- Contributions to evolving platforms like Storipod (micro-blogging with custom Stori formats and creator marketplace features)

I thrive on projects that emphasize security, scalability, and user engagement‚Äîlet's collaborate!
